## Purpose

Branching strategies help developers work together without messing up the main code. They let people create branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or changes. Later, these branches can be merged back safely. This way, many tasks can happen at the same time, and updates can be released smoothly.

## Introduction

Branching strategies are used to manage code changes efficiently in Git. This guide explains four common types:
- Feature Branch Flow
- Git Flow
- GitLab Flow
- Environment Branch Flow

---

## Types of Branching Strategies

### Feature Branch Flow

Feature Branch Flow is a straightforward and effective strategy where each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch. This approach ensures isolated development, making it easier to manage changes, conduct code reviews, and avoid disruptions to the main codebase.

#### Key Features:
- Short-lived branches dedicated to a single feature.
- Ideal for small teams or projects with simple development needs.
- Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch.

### Git Flow

Git Flow is a well-defined branching strategy that introduces multiple branches for feature development, releases, and hotfixes. This strategy is ideal for projects with a structured release cycle, helping manage development phases more effectively.

####  Key Features:
- Long-lived branches such as master, develop, and release.
- Feature branches for new features and hotfix branches for critical fixes.
- Clear separation between development, testing, and production-ready code.

For more details, refer to the [Git Flow Documentation]().

### GitLab Flow

GitLab Flow combines elements from both Feature Branch Flow and Git Flow, with a focus on deployment environments. It emphasizes continuous integration and deployment, making it a great choice for modern DevOps workflows.

### Key Features:
- Integrates environment branches (e.g., production, staging) with feature branches.
- Simplifies the merge and deployment processes.
- Supports CI/CD pipelines for streamlined automation.

For more details, refer to the [GitLab Flow Documentation]-102


### Environment Branch Flow

Environment Branch Flow involves using long-lived branches to represent different deployment environments such as development, staging, and production. This strategy enhances visibility into what code is deployed where and facilitates smooth promotion of code across environments.

#### Key Features:
- Long-lived branches represent distinct environments.
- Code promotion flows from less stable to more stable environments.
- Supports complex deployment scenarios with multiple testing or staging environments.

## How to Choose Branching Strategy

| Factor               | What to Use and When                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Team Size**        | Small team → Use **Feature Branch Flow**<br>Big team → Use **Git Flow**        |
| **Project Complexity** | If your project is complex → Use **Git Flow** or **Environment Branch Flow**  |
| **Release Frequency** | If you release updates very often → Use **GitLab Flow** or **Environment Branch Flow** |
| **Deployment Needs**  | If you want to manage different environments clearly → Use **Environment Branch Flow** |

## Comparison of Branching Strategies

| Feature                     | Feature Branch Flow | Git Flow      | GitLab Flow      | Environment Branch Flow |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity**              | Low                 | High          | Medium           | Medium                  |
| **Best For**                | Small projects      | Formal releases | CI/CD           | Multi-environment setups |
| **Release Cycle**           | Ad hoc              | Scheduled     | Continuous       | Environment-based       |
| **Branch Lifespan**         | Short-lived         | Long-lived    | Mixed            | Long-lived              |
| **Hotfix Management**       | Direct to main      | Hotfix branch | Direct to main   | Separate hotfix branch  |
| **Deployment Control**      | Low                 | Medium        | High             | Very High               |

## Conclusion

For this project, we are using the Feature Branch Flow, where each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch. This approach keeps development isolated, making it easier to manage changes, conduct code reviews, and ensure a stable main branch. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch.
