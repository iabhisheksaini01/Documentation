## What is a Seed Job?
A **Seed Job** in Jenkins is a special job responsible for creating and managing other Jenkins jobs automatically. It uses the **Job DSL plugin** or a **shared Jenkins library** to generate jobs dynamically, removing the need to manually create each pipeline or freestyle job.

---

## Why Seed Job?
- **Scalability**: Instead of manually creating dozens of Jenkins jobs, a seed job can generate them automatically from code.  
- **Consistency**: All jobs follow the same standards (naming, triggers, parameters, SCM, etc.).  
- **Version Control**: Job definitions are stored in Git, enabling history, rollback, and collaboration.  
- **Faster Onboarding**: New teams or projects can bootstrap jobs by just adding DSL scripts.  
- **Automation First**: Keeps Jenkins infrastructure as code, aligning with DevOps and GitOps practices.  
- **Easier Maintenance**: Updating one DSL script can update hundreds of jobs in one run.  

---

## Purpose of the Seed Job
- Centralizes job creation and configuration management.  
- Ensures consistency across multiple Jenkins jobs.  
- Reduces human error by automating repetitive setup tasks.  
- Provides version-controlled job definitions (stored in Git or other SCM).  
- Enables fast rollout of new jobs by simply updating the DSL script or shared library.

---

## Required Configurations
- **Plugins**:  
  - Job DSL Plugin  
  - Pipeline Plugin (if pipelines are generated)  
  - Git Plugin (for source control integration)  
- **Source Control Integration**:  
  - A Git repository storing DSL scripts or library code.  
- **Job DSL Script**:  
  - Defines how jobs should be created (naming conventions, triggers, SCM, parameters, etc.).  
- **Security & Access**:  
  - Ensure only admins or DevOps engineers can modify seed job definitions.  
- **Execution Agent**:  
  - Must have access to required tools (e.g., Git, build tools, artifact repos).

---

## How the Seed Job Automates Job Creation
1. Seed job fetches DSL scripts or shared library code from SCM.  
2. Jenkins Job DSL plugin parses the DSL script.  
3. DSL instructions create/update Jenkins jobs automatically.  
4. New jobs appear in Jenkins UI, ready for use.  
5. Updates to the DSL scripts in SCM can be reapplied via rerunning the seed job.  

---

## Steps to Maintain or Update Seed Job
- **Version Control**: Always update DSL scripts via Git commits.  
- **Testing Changes**: Validate scripts locally or in a non-prod Jenkins before applying.  
- **Updating Jobs**:  
  - Modify DSL or shared library code.  
  - Rerun the seed job to update existing jobs.  
- **Monitoring**:  
  - Review build logs of seed job for errors in DSL parsing.  
- **Documentation**:  
  - Keep a changelog of DSL updates.
