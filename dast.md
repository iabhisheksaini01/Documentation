## Introduction

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) identifies security vulnerabilities in running web applications by simulating real-world attacks. This document provides an overview of DAST, including what it is,Why DAST, its workflow, commonly used tools, key advantages, a Proof of Concept (PoC), and best practices.

## What is DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a method to find security weaknesses in a running web application by simulating real hacker attacks. It tests the application from the outside, just like an attacker would, to discover vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Why DAST?

| **Reason**                         | **Explanation**                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Finds security issues early**    | Helps developers detect vulnerabilities during development.               |
| **Saves cost**                     | Fixing problems early is cheaper than after deployment.                  |
| **Prevents breaches**              | Reduces the risk of data leaks and financial loss.                        |
| **Protects reputation**            | Avoids damage to company image due to security issues.                    |
| **Reduces human errors**           | Automated testing helps catch mistakes that might be missed manually.     |

## Best Practices
| **Best Practice**                         | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Define clear testing scope**            | Ensure only relevant parts of the application are tested.                     |
| **Integrate into CI/CD pipelines**        | Automate security testing for consistent evaluations.                         |
| **Regularly update tools**                | Use the latest updates to address emerging threats.                           |
| **Test in staging environments**          | Avoid disrupting production with security scans.                              |
| **Combine with other AST techniques**     | Use SAST and IAST along with DAST for comprehensive security coverage.        |
