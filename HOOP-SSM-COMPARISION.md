# HOOP.dev vs AWS SSM
## Cost & Auditing Comparison

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document provides a **clear cost and auditing comparison** between **HOOP.dev (open source)** and **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**.

---

## 2. Overview

### AWS SSM
AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is an **AWS-managed service** used to:
- Access EC2 instances without SSH
- Run commands remotely
- Record session activity

It works well for **infrastructure access**, but does **not provide native database user or query auditing**. Database logs can appear in CloudWatch only when enabled at the database engine level, which is independent of SSM.

---

### HOOP.dev
HOOP.dev is an **open-source access management platform** used to:
- Control access to EC2, RDS, and other resources
- Track user-level activity
- Perform detailed auditing

The software is free, but **infrastructure must be self-managed**. HOOP can run either on a central EC2 instance (recommended for production) or on a local system for POC and testing.

---

## 3. Cost Comparison

### Cost Assumptions (Example)
- 10 users
- 5 EC2 instances
- 1 RDS database
- Daily access
- Logs retained for 30 days

---

### AWS SSM – Cost Breakdown

| Component | Description | Approx Monthly Cost |
|--------|------------|--------------------|
| SSM Session Manager | Service usage | Free |
| CloudWatch Logs | Session + command logs (20–30 GB) | $10 – $15 |
| KMS | Encryption & API calls | $1 – $2 |
| S3 (Optional) | Log archival | $1 – $2 |

**Total AWS SSM Cost:**  
➡ **$15 – $25 per month**

**Notes:**
- Cost increases with log volume
- Limited control over log optimization

---

### HOOP.dev – Cost Breakdown

> **Note:** For POC or single-user testing, HOOP can run on a local system with near-zero additional cost. For production and multi-user usage, a central EC2-based deployment is recommended.

| Component | Description | Approx Monthly Cost |
|--------|------------|--------------------|
| HOOP Software | Open source | Free |
| EC2 (HOOP Server) | t3.small / t3.medium | $18 – $35 |
| Storage | Logs & metadata (30 GB) | $2 – $3 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (local or RDS) | $0 – $15 |

**Total HOOP Cost:**  
➡ **$30 – $50 per month**

**Notes:**
- Cost is predictable
- Full control over log storage

---
HOOP on On-Prem Server

If the organization already has:
- An on-prem Linux server
- Available CPU, RAM, and storage
- Network connectivity to AWS (VPN / Direct Connect)

Then:
- **HOOP software cost:** Free (open source)
- **New server cost:**  None
- **Cloud infrastructure cost:**  None

➡ **Incremental cost is effectively zero**


## 4. Auditing Comparison

> **Important clarification:** Database general/slow query logs visible in CloudWatch are generated by the database engine itself. They are **not produced or managed by AWS SSM**.

### AWS SSM Auditing

**What is available:**
- Who started the session
- Session start and end time
- Command execution (if logging enabled)

**Limitations:**
- No native database query auditing by SSM
- No direct mapping between AWS IAM user and database queries
- Database logs (if enabled) are engine-level and difficult to correlate with human users
- Logs are infra-focused

**Best for:**
- EC2 access auditing
- Basic operational tracking

---

### HOOP.dev Auditing

**What is available:**
- User-level access tracking
- EC2 and RDS access logs
- Database query auditing
- Centralized audit logs

**Advantages:**
- Strong security visibility
- Compliance-ready audit trails
- Easy investigation of misuse

**Best for:**
- Production systems
- Compliance (ISO, SOC2, etc.)


---

## 5. When to Use What

### HOOP Deployment Options
- **Local system:** Suitable for POC, demos, and learning. No extra infrastructure cost, but not production-ready.
- **EC2-based:** Suitable for production, team access, centralized auditing, and compliance.
- **On-Prem server:** Suitable when an organization already has on-prem infrastructure. No new cloud or license cost; ideal for centralized auditing with existing hardware.


---

### Use AWS SSM When:
- Small team
- Only EC2 access is required
- Low initial cost is important
- Basic infrastructure-level auditing is acceptable
- No database user or query-level auditing is required

---

### Use HOOP.dev When:
- Multiple users access infrastructure
- RDS / database auditing is required
- Compliance and security are priorities
- Centralized access control is needed
- An on-prem server is available and minimizing cloud cost is important
- Clear user attribution for database and infrastructure access is required


---
## 7. Final Summary

- **AWS SSM** is cost-effective for **basic EC2 access**. While database logs can be viewed in CloudWatch, they are generated by the database engine, lack strong human user attribution, and logging costs can grow silently with usage.
- **HOOP.dev** is free, open-source software with **predictable infrastructure cost**. When deployed on EC2 or on an existing on-prem server, it provides **strong user- and database-level auditing**, centralized access control, and is well suited for production and compliance-driven environments. On on-prem deployments, incremental cloud cost can be zero.

---

## 8. Conclusion

> **SSM for simple, EC2-only, low-cost access**  
> **HOOP for secure, auditable, and scalable access management (cloud or on-prem)**
