## Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d759234-fd75-4978-9c0a-24a0255612e2)

---

### 1. **BP Gateway**
- Acts as the **entry point** for all external and internal requests.
- Manages API routing, authentication, and access control.
- Ensures secure and scalable communication between clients and the internal system.

---

### 2. **BPCTL & Frontend**
- **BPCTL** is a Git-based CLI tool used for interacting with BuildPiper through configuration files.
- **Frontend** provides a web-based UI for visualizing pipelines, jobs, configurations, and metrics.
- These tools allow both **developers and platform engineers** to interact with the system effectively.

---

### 3. **Platform API**
- The core service that acts as a bridge between the frontend/CLI and the backend systems.
- Orchestrates workflows, handles REST requests, and performs validations.
- All job execution, resource provisioning, and platform operations are funneled through this layer.

---

### 4. **Core Backend Services**

| Component     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Redis**     | Used for **caching** and **message brokering**, improving performance and event-driven workflows. |
| **Database**  | Stores system state, job metadata, user configs, secrets, and audit logs. |
| **Deploy API**| Handles the deployment lifecycle of applications (build, release, deploy, rollback). |
| **Scheduler** | Orchestrates job execution order, retries, and time-based scheduling across templates. |

---

### 5. **Job Templates and Job Steps**
- **Job Templates** define reusable CI/CD workflows for common DevOps tasks.
- Each **Job Template** contains multiple **Job Steps**, executed sequentially:
  - Example steps: `Build`, `Test`, `Push`, `Deploy`, `Health Check`.
- This modular design allows consistent and versioned automation across projects.

---

### 6. **Shared File System**
- Enables **persistent and shared storage** for files across jobs and agents.
- Useful for transferring artifacts, logs, and temporary build files between steps and services.

---

### 7. **BP Agent**
- Installed on target environments (e.g., clusters, VMs).
- Executes actual deployment tasks, runs jobs, and reports back status.
- Enables hybrid/multi-cloud support and remote environment provisioning.
